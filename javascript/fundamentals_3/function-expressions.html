        /*Function Expressions
        
        There is another syntax for creating a function which is called a function expression. 
        
        It allows us to create a new function in the middle of any expression. For example, in a variable:*/

        let sayHi = function()
        {
            console.log("Hello");
        }; //as this is a variable declaration, we should still add a semi-colon here! Although it will still probably run without it just fine...

        /*So, here, we are setting the value of the variable to the function. In more advanced situations, a function may be created and immediately called or 
        scheduled for a later execution, not stored anywhere, thus remaining anonymous.*/

        /*Function is a value
        
        No matter how it's created, a function is a value. So, we can print out the value above:*/

        console.log(sayHi); //shows the function code!

        /*The line above DOES NOT run the code, as there is no paratheses after the function name (sayHi). Some languages do do this, but JS is not one of them.
        
        We can copy a function to another variable:*/

        function sayHi2()   //create
        {
            console.log("Hello");
        }

        let func = sayHi2;     //copy

        func();     //run the code!
        sayHi();    //and this still works, of course!

        /*Callback functions
        
        Here's another example of passing functions as values and using function expressions.
        
        We'll write a function 'ask(question, yes, no)'' with three parameters:
        
        question        Text of the question
        yes             Function to run if the answer is "Yes"
        no              Function to run if the answer is "No
        
        So, we need to ask the question and then, depending on the answer return yes or no:*/

        function ask(question, yes, no)
        {
            if(confirm(question)) yes()
            else no();
        }

        function showOK()
        {
            alert("You agreed.");
        }

        function showCancel() 
        {
            alert("You canceled the execution");
        }

        // usage: functions showOk, showCancel are passed as arguments to ask

        ask("Do you agree", showOk, showCancel);

        /*showOK and showCancel are callback functions - because we expect to call them back during a function. In this case, we want to call showOk if the user agrees 
        and showCancel if they don't. We can use Function Expressions to write an equivalent, shorter function:*/

        function ask(question, yes, no)
        {
            if(confirm(question)) yes()
            else no();
        }

        ask(
            "Do you agree?",
            function() {alert("You agreed.");},
            function() {alert("You cancelled the execution");}
        );

        /*Here, functions are declared inside the ask() call. They have no name, and so are called anonymous - they are not accessible outside of ask().*/

        /*Function Expression vs Function Declaration
        
        The first difference is the syntax.
        
        Function Declaration        a function, declared as a seperate statement in the main code flow:*/

            function sum(a, b)
            {
                return a + b;
            }

        /*
        Function Expression         a function, created inside an expression or inside another syntax construct. Here the function is created on the right side of the 
                                    "assignment expression" =:*/
            let sum = function(a, b)
            {
                return a + b;
            };
        
        /*The more subtle difference is WHEN a function is created by the JS engine.
        
        A function expression is created when the execution reaches it and is usable only from that moment.
        
        So, in an expression, once the execution flow passes to the right side of the assignment (=) - let sum = function (HERE!) - the function is created and can be used
        (assigned, called, etc.) from ow on.
        
        Function Declarations are different - this can be called ealier than it is defined!
        
        This is because of global function declarations - JS looks for these before running functions. We can think of it as an "initialization stage". For example, this works:*/

        sayHi3("John"); //Hello John

        function sayHi3(name) 
        {
            console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
        }

        //However, if it were an EXPRESSION, it wouldn't work!

        sayHi4("John"); //error!

        let sayHi4 = function(name)
        {
            console.log(`Hello, ${name}`);
        };

        /*Function expressions are created when the execution reaches them. This would happen only in the function(name) line. Too late.
        
        Another special feature is their block scope. In strict mode, when a Function Declaration is within a code block, it's visible everywhere inside that block. But not outside of it.
        
        So, let's imagine we need to declare a function welcome() depending on the age variable that we get during run time. If we use DECLARATION, it won't work as intended:*/

        let age = promt("What is your age", 18);

        //conditionally declare a function
        if (age < 18)
        {
            function welcome()
            {
                alert("Hello");
            }
        } else
        {
            function welcome()
            {
                alert("Greetings!");
            }
        }

        //... use it later
        welcome(); //Error: welcome is not defined.

        /*This is because a DECLARATION is only visible inside the code block in which it resides (i.e. in the function statement)

        So what can we do to make welcome() run outside of 'if'?
        
        What we can do is use an EXPRESSION and assign welcome to the variable that is declared outside of if and has the proper visibility:*/

        let age2 = prompt("What is your age", 18);

        let welcome2;

        if (age < 18)
        {
            welcome2 = function()
            {
                alert("Hello!");
            };
        } else
        {
            welcome2 = function()
            {
                alert("Greetings!");
            };
        }

        welcome2(); /*this works!

        Or to make it even simpler, we could use a question mark operator:*/

        let age3 = prompt("What is your age?", 18);

        let welcome3 = (age3 < 18) ?
        function() {alert("Hello!"); } :
        function() {alert("Greetings!");};

        welcome3(); // works!

        /*When to choose a declaration or an expression:
        
        As a rule of thumb, when we need to declare a function, the first thing we need to consider is Function Declaration syntax. It gives way more freedom in how we 
        organise our code, because we can call functions before they are declared.
        
        That's also better for readability, as it's easier to look up 'function f(...) {...} in the code then let f = function (...) {...}.
        
        ...But if a Declaration does not suit us for some reason, or we need a conditional declaration (as above), then Expression should be used.*/

        /*Summary
            Functions are values. They can be assigned, copied or declared in any place of the code.

            If the function is declared as a separate statement in the main code flow, that’s called a “Function Declaration”.

            If the function is created as a part of an expression, it’s called a “Function Expression”.

            Function Declarations are processed before the code block is executed. They are visible everywhere in the block.

            Function Expressions are created when the execution flow reaches them.
            
            In most cases when we need to declare a function, a Function Declaration is preferable, because it is visible prior to the declaration itself. 
            That gives us more flexibility in code organization, and is usually more readable.

        So we should use a Function Expression only when a Function Declaration is not fit for the task. We’ve seen a couple of examples of that in this chapter, 
        and will see more in the future.
        
        SO we should use DECLARATIONS as a priority, but we can always use expressions later on. Let's remind ourselves of the syntax of declarations:
        
            if (condition)
            {
                function functionName()
                {
                    code to be executed;
                } //followed by else clauses etc.
            }
                */
