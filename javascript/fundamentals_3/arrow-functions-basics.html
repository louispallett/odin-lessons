        /*Arrow functions - the basics
        
        This is a very simple and concise (but relatively new) way of writing functions, that's often better than expressions. "Arrow Functions" look like this:
        
        let func = (arg1, arg2, ..., argN) => expression;
        
        This creates a function (func) that accepts arguments arg1...argN, then evaluates the eexpression on the right side with their use and returns its results. 
        In other words, a shorter version of:
        
        let func = function(arg1, arg2, ..., argN)
        {
            return expression;
        };
        
        A concert example:*/

        let sum = (a, b) => a + b;

        /* This arrow function is a shorter form of:

        let sum = function(a, b) {
        return a + b;
        };
        */

        console.log(sum(1, 2)); //3

        /*As you can see, (a, b) => a + b means a function that accepts two arguments named a and b. Upon the execution, it evaluates the expression a + b and returns 
        the result.
        
        If there is only one argument, the parentheses can be removed:*/

        let double = n => n * 2; 
        // roughly the same as: let double = function(n) { return n * 2 }

        console.log(double(3)); //6

        /*Arrow functions can be used in the same way as expressions - like to dynamically create a function:*/

        let age = prompt("What is your age?", 18);

        let welcome = (age < 18) ?
        () => alert("Hello!") : 
        () => alert("Greetings");

        welcome();

        /*These arrow functions are fairly simple however, taking arguments from the left of =>, evaluated and returned the right-side expression with them.
        
        What about when we have a more complex function? In that case, we can enclose them with curly brackets. However, the major difference is that curly brackets
        require a return within them to return a value (just like a regular function does). Like so:*/

        let sum2 = (a, b) => 
        { //the curly bracket opens a multiline function
            let result = a + b;
            return result; //must have an explicit return value when using curly brackets
        }; //must end with a semi-colon!

        console.log(sum2(1,2)); //3
