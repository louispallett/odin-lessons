        /*Parameters and Arguments
        
        In JS, parameters are the items listed between the parentheses in the function declaration. By putting animal as the parameter, we are telling JS that we will 
        give some value when we call the faviouriteAnimal function. This makes the 'animal' just a placeholder for some future value. 
        
        "Goat" on the other hand, is our argument. log() is another function cell, so we are passing one function cell into another. You'll be doing this a lot in 
        programming.*/

        /*MDN Article - Functions
        
        Function Declaration
        
        To create a function we can use a function declaration. It looks like this:*/

        function showMessage() 
        {
            console.log("Hello everyone!");
        }

        /*So function keyword followed by the name with parentheses after (with a parameter if necessary) and finally the code (also called the function body). Our 
        function can be called by it's name:*/

        showMessage();

        /*Parameters
        
        We can pass arbitary data to functions using parameters. 
        
        In the example below, the function has two parameters: from and text:*/

        function showMessage2(from, text)
        {
            console.log(from + " " + text);
        }

        showMessage2("Ann", "Hello!"); //Ann: Hello!
        showMessage2("Ann", "What's up?"); //Ann: What's up?

        /*This is a local variable but it can only be used in this function so is cleaner and quicker - we are just 'declaring' from and text when we call the 
        function.*/

        //In the below example, we pass a variable into 'from' before:

        function showMessage3(from, text)
        {
            from = "*" + from + "*";
            console.log(from + ": " + text);
        }

        let from = "Ann";

        showMessage3(from, "Hello"); //*Ann*: Hello

        /*Default values
        
        Modern JS engines support the nullish coalescing operator '??', it's better when most falsy values, such as 0, should be considered normal:*/

        function showCount(count) 
        {
            console.log(count ?? "unknown"); //what we are saying is 'take in the parameter "count", but if nothing or undefined/null given (i.e. a false value), then return this'
        }

        showCount(0); //0
        showCount(null) //unknown
        showCount(); //unknown

        /*Returning a value
        
        A function can return a value back into the calling code as the result. The simplest example would be a function that sums two values:*/

        function sum(a, b)
        {
            return a + b;
        }

        let result = sum(1, 2);
        console.log(result); //3

        /*The directive return can be anywhere within the function, but when the execution reaches it, the function stops, adn the value is returned to the calling code.
        
        There may be many occurances of return in a singe function: for instance:*/

        function checkAge(age) {
        if (age >= 18) 
        {
            return true;
        } else 
        {
            return confirm('Do you have permission from your parents?');
        }
        }

        let age = prompt('How old are you?', 18);

        if (checkAge(age)) 
        {
        console.log('Access granted');
        } else 
        {
        console.log('Access denied');
        }

        //It is possible to use return without a value. This causes the function to exit immediately - for example:

        function showMovie (age)
        {
            if (!checkAge(age))
            {
                return;
            }

            console.log("Showing you the movie");
        }

        showMovie(); //if check age returns false, then showMove won't proceed to the console.log().

        /*Naming functions
        
        You should use a verb to start naming a function - such as 'showMovie' etc. Here is the general practice list:
        
        "get…"          return a value,
        "calc…"         calculate something,
        "create…"       create something,
        "check…"        check something and return a boolean, etc.
        
        Also remember - one function, one action. Functions should only do one thing - not multiple things, just create multiple functions for this!*/
