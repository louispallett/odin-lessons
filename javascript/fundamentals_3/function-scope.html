        /*Function scope and conflicts
        
        When you create a function, the variables and other things defined indide the function are inside their own seperate scope, meaning that they are locked away 
        in their own seperate compartments, unreachable from code outside the function.
        
        The top level outside all your functions is called the gtlobal scope. Values defined inside the global scope are accessable everywhere.
        
        The reason for this is that sometimes you don't want variables to be accessible from everywhere else in the code - this could cause problems because they 
        happen to be using the same variable names as other parts of the code, causing conflicts.
        
        Let's say you have two .js files for one HTML file and they both have a function called greeting(). If you try to call greeting(), it will only ever call the 
        first .js script and the second one is simply ignored.*/
