        /*Basic Operators
        Terms: "unary","binary", "operand"

        Operands, as we learned before are the two numbers which make up an equation left and right of the operator. For example, in the equation 5 * 2 = 10, 5 and 2 are
        the operands. Similarly, if we had two variables named left and right in the equation left + right = x, the operands would be "left" and "right" (you see what I 
        did there?!)
        >>NOTE: Sometimes operands are called arguments.

        An OPERATOR is "unary" if it has a single operand. For example, the unary negation "-" reverses the sign of a number:
        */

        let x = 1;

        x = -x;
        console.log(x); //-1, unary negation was applied.

        //An operator is BINARY if it has two operands. The same minus exists in binary form as well:

        let xa = 1, y = 3;
        console.log(y - xa); //2, binary minus subtracts values.

        /*Remainder %
        
        The remainder operator (%) is not related to percentages. The result of a % b is the remainder of the integer division of a by b. For example:
        */

        console.log(5 % 2); //1 the remainder of 5 / 2
        console.log(8 % 3); //2, the remainder of 8 / 3
        console.log(8 % 4); //0, the remainder of 8 / 4

        /*Exponentiation **
        
        The exponentiation operator a ** b raises a to the power of b. For instance:
        */

        console.log(2 ** 2); //4
        console.log(2 ** 3); //8
        console.log(2 ** 4); //16

        //Just like in maths, the exponentiation operator is defined for non-integer numbers as well. For example, a square root is an exponentiation by 1/2:

        console.log(4 ** (1/2)); //2 (power of 1/2 is same as SQUARE root)
        console.log(8 ** (1/3)); //2 (power of 1/3 is same as CUBIC root)

        /*String concatenation with binary +
        
        Usually, the plus operator (+) sums numbers. But if the binary + is applied to strings, it merges (concatenates) them:*/

        let s = "my" + "string";
        console.log(s); //mystring

        //If any of the operands is a string, then the other one is converted to a string too:

        console.log('1' + 2); //"12"
        console.log(2 + '1'); // "21"

        /*Numeric Conversion, unary +
        
        The plus + exists in two forms: the binary form (that we used above) and the unary form.
        
        The unary plus or, in other words, the plus when added to a single value, doesn't do anthing to numbers. However, if the operand is not a number, the 
        unary plus converts it into a number. See below:*/

        let xc = 1;
        console.log(+x); //outputs 1 (no change)

        let ya = -2;
        console.log(+y) //outputs -2 (no change)

        //Converts non-numbers:
        console.log(+true); //1
        console.log(+""); //0

        /*It actually does the same thing as "Number(), but in short!
        
        The need to do this comes up when getting values from a HTML form fields (whihc are usually strings). What if we want to sum them?

        Binary plus would add them as strings:
        */

        let apples = "2";
        let oranges = "3";

        console.log(apples + oranges); //"23", is contatenated

        //If we want to treat them as nubmers, we need to convert and then sum them:

        console.log(+apples + +oranges); //both values converted to numbers before the binary plus. Outputs 5

        /*Chaining assignments
        
        Another interesting feature is the ability to chain assignments:*/

        let d, e, f;

        d = e = f = 2 + 2;

        console.log(d); //4
        console.log(e); //4
        console.log(f); //4

        /*Chained assignments evaluate from right to left! First, the rightmost expression '2 + 2' is evaluated and then assigned to the variables on the left f, e, and d.
        At the end, all the variables share a single value.
        
        Once again, for the purposes of readability, it is better to split such code into a few lines.*/

        /*Modify in place
        
        We often need to apply an operator to a variable and store the new result in that same variable. For example:*/

        let n = 2;
        n = n + 5;
        n = n * 2;

        //This notation can be shortened using the operators += and *=:

        let na = 2;
        na += 5; //now na = 7 (same as na = na + 5;)
        na *= 2; //now na = 14 (same as na = na * 2;)

        console.log(na); //14

        /*Increment and decrement
        
        As previously mentioned, we can assign increment or decrement only to variables, and this can be done before or after the variable - i.e.:
        
        ++counter
        OR
        counter++
        
        Is there a difference?

        They do exactly the same thing, but there is a difference, but we can only see it if we use the returned value of ++/--.

        As we know, all operators return a value. The prefix form returns the new value while the postfix form returns the old value (prior to increment/decrement).
        */

        let counterA = 1;
        let ac = ++counterA; //(*)

        console.log(ac);

        //So, in the line (*), the prefix form ++counter increments counter and returns the new value, 2. So, the console shows 2.

        //Now, let's use the postfix form:

        let counterB = 1;
        let ad = counterB++; //(*) Now postfix

        console.log(ad); //1

        //In the line (*), the postfix form counter++ also increments counter but returns the old value (prior to increment). So, the console shows 1.

        /*Bitwise operators
        
        Bitwise operators treat arguments as 32-bit integer numbers and work on the level of their binary representation. 
        
        They are, of course, not JS specific, and you've seen them in Java and C#. The list is as follows:
        
        AND                     &
        OR                      |
        XOR                     ^
        NOT                     ~
        LEFT SHIFT              <<
        RIGHT SHIFT             >>
        ZERO-FILL RIGHT SHIFT   >>>

        These are used very rarely, when we need to fiddle with numbers on the very lowest (bitwise) level. Web development has very little use of them, but in some 
        special areas, such as cryptography, they are useful.*/

        /*Comma Operator
        
        The comma operator is one of the rarest and most unusual operator. Sometimes, it's used to write shorted code, so we need to know it in order to understand 
        what's going on.
        
        The comma operator allows us to evaluate several expressions, dividing them with a comma ','. Each of them is evaluated but only the result of the last one 
        is returned. For example:*/

        let ae = (1 + 2, 3 + 4);

        console.log(ae); //7 (the result of 3 + 4)

        /*Here, the first expression is evaluated and then thrown away. Then 3 + 4 is evaluated and returned as the result.

        NOTE: the comma operator has an extremely low precedence - even lower than the = operator. So you must you brackets () when using the comma operator, 
        otherwise the expression will be evaluated before it uses that comma operator!

        Why do we need an operator that throws away everything except the last expression?

        Sometimes, people use it in more complex contracts to put several actions in one line. For example:*/

        // three operations in one line
        for (a = 1, b = 3, c = a * b; a < 10; a++) 
        {
            //code to be executed in the for loop here
        }

        /*
        10
        -1
        error?
        2
        6
        9px
        $45
        2
        NaN
         -9 5
        -14
        1
        NaN
        ?
        */
