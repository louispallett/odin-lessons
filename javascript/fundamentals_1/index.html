<!--
Important information regarding this lesson on variables:

1. How we declare a variable:

    let     standard way
    const   declares a constant
    var     an old version no longer in use

2. Naming conventions for constant variables:

    We would use upper case and '_' for constants with pre-determined variables (such as colours - const COLOR_RED = #F00).
    Whereas we would use standard naming conventions for non-determined variables (such as const pageLoadingTime = (Page load time)).

<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
        <title>Hello World!</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <script>
            //the JavaScript will go here. So, it is nested inside the <body> element.
            //also, note that '//' works as a comment within the <script> element but not the html element! It's because we are writing it in a different language now.

            /*
            As you can see, in this example we have listed the javascript within the <script> element. However, if you want to have it in an external file, similar to CSS, you
            can do this by writing the following code:

                <script src="javascript.js">
    
            Javascript files have a .js extention. External javascript files are used for more complex scripts*/
            console.log("Hello, World!")

            /*
            Variables
            
            We can use variables to store data, such as store goods, visitors, and other data.
            
            To create a variable in js, we use the 'let' keyword*/

            let message = "Hello!";
            
            //it is now saved in the memory area associated with the variable. We can acces it using the variable name:
            
            alert(message); //shows the variable content

            //We can also declare multiple variables on one line:

            let user = "John", age = 25, message2 = "Hello"; 

            //However, it is recomended to store these on different lines:

            let user2 = "John";
            let age2 = 25;
            let message3 = "Hello";

            //In older scripts, you may see the 'var' keyword (instead of let) - they are almost the same, but have some differences.

            //We can also declare two variables and copy data from one into the other:

            let hello = "Hello World!";
            let messageCopy;

            //copy 'Hello World' from hello into messageCopy:

            messageCopy = hello;

            //now both variables hold the same data:

            alert(hello);
            alert(messageCopy);

            //However, declaring twice will deliver an error! So only declare the variable (i.e. let name = variable) once!

            /* Variable naming
            
            There are two limitations on variable names in JS:

                1. The name must contain only letters, digits or symbols $ and _
                2. The first character must not be a digit
            
                The $ _ don't have any special meaning, they are just commonly used.
            
            Some examples of incorrect names:
            
                let 1a; (cannot start with digit)
                let my-name; (hypans aren't allowed!)
            
            There are also some restrictions on names which already have meanings (such as let, return, class, and function)
            */

            /*Constants
            
            To declare a constant (unchanging) variable, use const instead of let:*/

            const myBirthday = "09.04.1997";

            /*Variables declared using constants cannot be redefined, and if they were an error would be thrown.
            
            Uppercase Constants:
            There is a widespread consensus to use constants as aliases for difficult to remember values that are known prior to execusion.

            Such constants are named with capital letters and underscores.

            An example would be colors in hexadecimal format:
            */

            const COLOR_RED = "#F00";
            const COLOR_GREEN = "#0F0";
            const COLOR_BLUE = "#00F";
            const COLOR_ORANGE = "FF7F00";

            /*Benefits:
            
            COLOR_ORANGE is much easier to remember than #FF7F00
            It's also easier to spell (and therefore easier to not make a mistake)
            It is also more meaningful when reading the code.
            
            When to use a constant?
            
            There are two real types: those which values are known already (such as a colour - that value cannot change) and then there are times in which constants are
            calculated in run-time (during the execution) but do not change after their initial assignment
            
            such as:

            const pageLoadTime = (time taken by a webpage to load)
            
            pageLoadTime is not known prior to the page load, and therefore it is named normally (not all caps), but because it cannot change once assigned, it is a constant.*/
