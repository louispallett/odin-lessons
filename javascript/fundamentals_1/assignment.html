        /*JavaScript Numbers
        
        JavaScript only has one type of number - they can be written with or without decimals:*/

        let x = 3.13;
        let y = 3;

        //Extra large or small numbers can be written with scientific (exponent) notion:

        let xa = 123e5;     //12300000
        let ya = 123e-5;    //0.00123
        
        //What the 'e' does is moves the number up or down by that stated e number - so in the first example, this adds 5 zeros to the number.

        /*JavaScript numbers are always 64-bit floating point
        
        Unlike many other languages, JS does not define different types of numbers (like int, short, long, etc. in Java) 
        JavaScript numbers are always stored as double precision floating point numbers, following the international IEEE 754 standard.
        
        Integer Precision - integers (umbers without a period or exponent notation) are accurate up to 15 digits:*/

        let xb = 999999999999999 //will be 999999999999999
        let yb = 9999999999999999 // will be 10000000000000000

        //Whereas, the maximum number of decimals is 17.

        /*Floating precision
        
        Floating point arithmetic (which JS uses) is not always 100% accurate:*/

        let xc = 0.2 + 0.1; //would output 0.3000000000004

        //So to solve this, it helps to multiply and then divide:

        let xd = (0.2 * 10 + 0.1 * 10) / 10; //outputs 0.3

        /*Adding Strings and numbers
        
        You cannot add strings to numbers and get a resulting number. This may be obvious in the below example:*/

        let xe = "10";
        let ye = 20;
        let z = xe + ye; //outputs 1020, because it is converted into a string.

        //HOWEVER, this also is the same with sentences too - which is where it differs from, say, Java:

        let xf = 10;
        let yf = 20;
        let za = "The result is: " + xf + yf; //Would actually output "The result is 1020" - not 30!
    
        //A common mistake would be to expect the below to return 102030:

        let xg = 30;
        let zb = xf + yf + za; //Actually returns 3030

        //The reason is that JS works left to right. So it first adds 10 to 20, giving 30 and then 30 to the string 30, giving 3030.

        /*Numeric Strings
        
        JS strings can have numerical content and so JS will try to convert strings to numbers in all numeric operations The below would work:
        
        let x = "100";
        let y = "10";
        let z = x / y   Would output 10
        
        This would also work with multiplication (*) and subtraction (-) but NOT addition (+)
        This is because JS uses + to concatenate strings.*/

        /*Assignment Operators
        
        The most common assignment operator you see is the '=' one, which is obviously used in variables. However, there is a whole list of assignment
        operators, as listed below:
        
        Operator        Name                        Purpose                                                                                                     Example         Shortcut for
        +=              Addition assignment         Adds the value on the right to the variable value on the left, then returns the new variable value.         x += 4;         x = x + 4;
        -=              Subtraction assignment      Subtracts the value on the right from the variable value on the left, and returns the new variable value.   x -= 3;         x = x - 3;
        *=              Multiplication assignment   Multiplies the variable value on the left by the value on the right, and returns the new variable value.    x *= 3;         x = x * 3;
        /=              Division assignment         Divides the variable value on the left by the value on the right, and returns the new variable value.       x /= 5;         x = x / 5;               
        
        These can also be used in expressions, such as:*/

        let mainNum = 3; //mainNum contains the value of 3
        let multiNum = 4; //multiNum contains the value of 4
        mainNum *= multiNum; //mainNum now contains the value of 12 (i.e. 3 * 4)
