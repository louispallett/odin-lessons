        /*Basic Maths in JavaScript
        
        In programming we have three types of numbers:
        
        Integers        Float-pointing numbers without a franction. THey can be either positive or negative (10, 234, or -5)
        Floats          Also known as floating point numbers have decimal points and places - 12.5 and 56.7786543.
        Doubles         A spacific type of floating point number that have greater precision (i.e. more decimal places)

        In JS however, we only have two types, and one is rarely used. This is simply 'Number'. The other type is BigInt and this is just for 
        MASSIVE integers.
        */

        const myInt = 5;
        const myFLoat = 6.667;

        console.log(typeof myInt);
        console.log(typeof myFLoat);

        /*Useful number methods
        
        We can implement a number of useful methods with numbers - one of this is the 'toFixed()' method, which we use to round a number to a fixed number of decimal
        places. For exmaple, as below:*/

        const lotsOfDecimal = 1.766584958675746364;
        console.log(lotsOfDecimal);
        const twoDecimalPlaces = lotsOfDecimal.toFixed(2);
        console.log(twoDecimalPlaces);

        /*Converting to number data types
        
        Sometimes you need to use a number which has been entered as a String, but you need it as a number. A very common case is during the completion of a form, where the input type is text.
        The way to solve this is by passing the string value into the Number() constructor to return a number version of the same value:

        
        console.log(myNumber += 3); //comes out as 743, because it's adding a number and a string.

        To fix this, you can do the following:
        */
        let myNumber = "74";
        console.log(myNumber = Number(myNumber) + 3); //outputs 77, as expected!

        console.log(60 % 3); //outputs 0, which is correct, as 3's fit perfectly into 60!
        
        /*Increments and Decrements
        
        These are very useful features and used a lot. For example, if you are designing a guessing game, you'll want to keep track of how many times the player guesses - here you can use an increment operator
        (or a decrement operator if they only have a finite number of guesses!)
        
        However, you cannot use either directly on a number, like so:
        
        3++;
        
        They have to be applied directly to a variable, for example:*/
        
        let num2 = 6;
        num2--;
        console.log(num2); //outputs 5.

        /*Compression Operators
        
        Sometimes we want to run true/false tests, then act accordingly depending on the result of that test - to do this we run comparison operators:
        
        Operator        Name                        Purpose                                                                         Example    
        ===             Strict equality             Tests whether the left and right values are identical to one another            5 === 2 + 4 
        !==             Strict-non-equality         Tests whether the left and right values are not identical to one another        5 !== 2 + 3
        <               Less than                   Tests whether the left value is smaller than the right one.                     10 < 6  
        >               Greater than                Tests whether the left value is greater than the right one.                     10 > 20
        <=              Less than or equal to       Tests whether the left value is smaller than or equal to the right one.         3 <= 2
        >=              Greater than or equal to    Tests whether the left value is greater than or equal to the right one.         5 >= 4
