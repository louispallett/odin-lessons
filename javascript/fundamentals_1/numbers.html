        /*Arithmetic Operations
        A typical arithmetic operation operates on two numbers.

        They can be literals:

        let x = 100 + 50;

        Or they can be variables:

        let x = a + b;

        Or expressions:
        */
        let x = (100 + 50) * a;

        /*Operators and Operands
        The numbers (in an arithmetic operation) are called operands.
        The operation is defined by an operator:
        
        Operand         Operator        Operand
        100             +               50
        */

        let y = 100 + 50 * 3;
        
        /*Operator Precedence 
        
        Is the result of the example above the same as 150*3 or isit the same as 100 + 50? i.e. Is addition or multiplication done first?

        Just like traditional maths, multiplication is done first (BIDMAS).

        Multiplication (*) and division (/) have a higher precedence than addition (+) and subtraction (-).

        And parentheses () are always completed first.

        BUT unlike BIDMAS - it's actually just multiplation and division and then addition and subtraction (only two levels of priority)

        If this is conflicted, it is just done from left to right! So, below
        */
        let r = 100 / 50 * 3;

        //The above would do 100 / 50 first (2) and then 2 * 3 so would output 6.
