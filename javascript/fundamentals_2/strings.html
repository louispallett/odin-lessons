        /*Escaping characters in a string
        
        As you know, you can use either single or double quotation marks for strings. I recommend using double, as when you want to include an 
        apostraphe in a sentence, it will confuse the browser and think you are ending the string! However, if you do use this, there is a way to 
        get around it (and is still useful when you want to use double quotation marks in a string):*/

        console.log(bigmouth);

        //So, we just put a backslash (\) in front of the apostraphe (or quotation mark - it works for \" too).

        /*Concatenation with ${...}
        
        We learned about this in the data types, but you can also use it to join together two variables:*/

        const one = "Hello, ";
        const two = "how are you?";
        const joined = `${one}${two}`;
        console.log(joined); //"Hello, how are you?"

        /*Converting numbers to strings and strings to numbers
        
        We can use the Number() to covert a string to a number and toString() to convert a number to a string:*/

        const myString = "123";
        const myNum = Number(myString);
        console.log(typeof myNum); //Number

        const myNum2 = 123;
        const myString2 = myNum2.toString();
        console.log(typeof myString2); //String

        /*Including expressions in strings
        
        You can include JS expressions in template literals, as well as simple variables, and the results will be included in the result:*/

        const song = "Fight the Youth";
        const score = 9;
        const highestScore = 10;
        const output = `I like the song ${song}. I gave it a score of ${
        (score / highestScore) * 100
        }%.`;
        console.log(output); // "I like the song Fight the Youth. I gave it a score of 90%."
