        /*Logical Operators
        
        There are four logical operators in JS:
        ||      OR
        &&      AND
        !       NOT
        ??      Nullish Coalescing
        
        Here we cover the first three. Although they are refered to as 'logical', they can be applied to values of any type (not just boolean). The result can also be 
        of any type.
        
        We'll go through them one by one.*/

        /*|| OR
        
        In classical programming, this operator only returns a boolean type (i.e. true or false), but in JS, the operator is a little bit tricker and more powerful.*/

        result = a || b;

        //Let's see what happens with boolean types. There are four possible logical combinations:

        console.log( true || true );   // true
        console.log( false || true );  // true
        console.log( true || false );  // true
        console.log( false || false ); // false

        /*Here, the result is true except for the case when both operands are false.
        
        If an operand is not a boolean, it's converted into one for the evaluation.
        
        For example, the number 1 is treated as true, the number 0 as false:*/

        if (1 || 2) //works just like if (true || false)
        {
            console.log("truthy!");
        }

        //Most of the time, OR || is used in an if statement to test if any of the given conditions are true:

        let hour = 9;

        if(hour < 10 || hour > 18)
        {
            console.log("The office is closed.");
        }

        //we can pass more conditionals too:

        let hour1 = 12;
        let isWeekend = true;

        if(hour1 < 10 || hour > 18 || isWeekend) 
        {
            console.log("The office is closed.");
        }
        
        /*OR || finds the first truthy value
        
            The logic described above is somewhat classical. Now, let's bring in the "extra" features of JS.
            
            The extended algorithm works as follows.
            
            Given multiple OR'ed values:*/

            result = value1 || value2 || value3;

            /*The OR || operator does the following:
            
            1. Evaluates operands from left to right.
            2. For each operand, converts it to boolean. If the result is true, stops and returns the original value of that operand.
            3. If all operands have been evaluated (i.e. all were false), returns the last operand.
            
            A value is returned in its original form, without the conversion.
            
            In other words, a chain of OR || returns the first truthy vbalue or the last one if no truthy value is found. For instance:*/

            console.log(1 || 0); // 1 (1 is truthy)
            console.log(null || 1); // 1 (1 is the first truthy value)
            console.log(null || 0 || 1); // 1 (the first truthy value)
            console.log(undefined || null || 0); // 0 (all falsy, returns the last value)

            //Remember! 0 is false, 1 is true.

            /*This leads to some interesting usage compared to a "pure, classical, boolean-only OR".
            
            1. Getting the first truthy value from a list of variables or expressions
            
                So, for example, let's say we have the variables firstName, lastName, and nickName and these are all options (i.e. can be undefined
                or have falsy values)
                
                Using OR || we can choose the one that has the data and show it (or "Anonymous" if nothing is set):*/

                let firstName = "";
                let lastName = "";
                let nickName = "SuperCoder";

                console.log(firstName || lastName || nickName); //returns SuperCoder

            /*2. Short-circuit evaluation
            Another feature of OR || operator is the "short-circuit" evaluation
            
            This means that || processes its arguments until the first truthy value is reached, and then the value is returned immediately, without even touching 
            the other argument.
            
            The importance of this feature becomes obvious if an operand isn't just a value, but an expression with a side effect, such as a variable assignment
            or a function call. Below, only the second message is printed*/

            true || console.log("not printed");
            false || console.log("printed");

            // In the first line, the OR || operator stops the evaluation immediately upon seeing true, so the log isn't run.
            //Sometimes, this feature is used to execute commands only if the condition on the left part is falsy.

        /*&& (AND)
        
            The AND operator is represented with two ampersands &&:*/

            result = a && b;

            //In classical programming, AND returns true if both operands are truthy and false otherwise:

            console.log(true && true);   // true
            console.log(false && true);  // false
            console.log(true && false);  // false
            console.log(false && false); // false

            //An example with if:

            let hour2 = 12;
            let minute = 30;

            if (hour2 == 12 && minute == 30) 
            {
                console.log("The time is 12:30");
            }

            //Just as with OR, any value is allowed as an operand of AND:

            if (1 && 0) //evaluated as true && false (1 being true and 0 being false)
            {
                console.log("won't work, because the result is falsy")
            }

            /*AND "&&" finds the first falsy value
            
            Given multiple AND'ed values:
            
            result = value1 && value2 && value3;
            
            The AND && operator does the following:
            
            1. Evaluates operands from left to right
            2. For each operand, converts it to a boolean. If the result is false, stops and returns the original value of that operand.
            3. If all operands have been evaluated (i.e. all were truthy), returns the last operand.
            
            In other words, AND returns the first falsy value or the last value if none were found.
            
            The rules above are similar to OR. The difference is that AND returns the first falsy value while OR returns the first truthy one. So:*/

            console.log(1 && 0); // 0
            console.log(1 && 5); // 5

            // if the first operand is falsy,
            // AND returns it. The second operand is ignored
            console.log(null && 5); // null
            console.log(0 && "no matter what"); // 0

            //We can also pass several values in a row. See how the first falsy one is returned:

            console.log(1 && 2 && null && 3); //null

            //When all values are truthy, the last value is returned:

            console.log(1 && 2 && 3); //3, the last one

        /*Precedence of AND && is higher than OR ||
        
        So, the code a && b || c && d is essentially the same as if the && expressions were in parentheses: (a && b) || (c && d)*/

        /*/!\ Don't replace if with || or &&
        
        Sometimes, people use the AND && operator as a "shorter way to write if" For instance:*/

        let x = 1;

        (x > 0) && console.log("Greater than zero");

        //The action in the right part of && would only execute if the evaluation reaches it. That is, only if (x > 0) is true.

        /*So, we basically have an analogue for the above line but without the &&.
        
        Although, the variant with && appears shorter, if is more obvious and tends to be a little bit more readable. So we recommend using every construct for its
        purpose: use 'if' if we want 'if' and use '&&' if we want AND.*/    

        /*! (NOT)
        
            The boolean NOT operator is represented with an exclamation sign !. The syntax is pretty simple:*/

            result = !value;

            /*The operator accepts a single argument and does the following:
            
            1. Converts the operand to boolean type: true/false
            Returns the inverse value
            For instance:*/

            console.log(!true); //false
            console.log(!0); //true

            //A double NOT !! is sometimes used for converting a value to boolean type:

            console.log(!!"not-empty string"); //true
            console.log(!!null); //false

            /*That is, the first NOT converts the value to bollean and returns the inverse, and the second NOT inverses it again. In the end, we have a plain
            value-to-boolean conversion.
            
            There's a little more verbose way to do the same thing - a built-in Boolean function:*/

            console.log(Boolean("non-empty string")); //true
            console.log(Boolean(null)); //false

            //The precedence of NOT ! is the highest of all logical operators, so it always executes first, before && or ||.

        /*The exercises: Below are the exercises and their answers and explanations!*/

        //1

        console.log(null || 2 || undefined); //2 (With the OR || statement, null and undefined are both falsy, but 2 is truthy and the evaluation stops once a truthy value is reached)

        //2

        console.log(alert(1) || 2 || alert(3)); //1, then 2. 'alert' is evaluated but returns undefined - the value to the left of the operator is then output (1) followed by the first truthy value (2). The evaluation then stops.

        //3

        console.log(1 && null && 2); //null. The && operator returns the first falsy value.

        //4

        console.log(alert(1) && alert(2)); //1, then undefined. The call to alert returs undefined first, but it shows a message, so there is no meaningful return. Because of this, && returns the left operand (outputing 1) and immediately stops, because undefined is a falsy value - then && looks for a falsy value and returns it.

        //5

        console.log(null || 2 && 3 || 4); //3. You know that && takes precedence over ||, so this is done first. Both are true statements, so && just outputs the last number (this being 3), then the || statements are done, null is false, so it skips this, 3 is true, so it stops and outputs it!

        //6

        let age;

        if (age >= 14 && age >= 90) 
        {
            console.log ("This text!")
        }

        //7

        if (!(age >= 14 && age <= 90)) 
        {
            //execution
        }

        if(age < 14 || age > 90) 
        {
            //execution
        }

    /*Some important takeaways:
    
    1. These logical operators are for use inside conditional statements only. So as below:
    
        if (variable === variable || variable && variable)
        {
            (code to be executed)
        }
    
    Therefore you shouldn't be using them outside of this environment!
    
    2.  OR || finds the first truthy value and returns it
    3.  AND && finds the first falsy value and returns it. If there are none, it will return the last!*/
