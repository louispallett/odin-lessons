        /*Switch statements
        
        if...else statements are great when running a few conditions, but what about when you have a lot of statements to run through? Here we would use a switch 
        statement.
        
        These take a single expression/value as an input, and then look through several choices until they find the one that matches that value, executing the 
        corresponding cove that goes along with it. See the syntax below:
        
        switch (expression) {
        case choice1:
            run this code
            break;

        case choice2:
            run this code instead
            break;

        // include as many cases as you like

        default:
            actually, just run this code
        }
        
        Here we got:

        1.The keyword switch, followed by a set of parentheses.
        2.An expression or value inside the parentheses.
        3.The keyword case, followed by a choice that the expression/value could be, followed by a colon.
        4.Some code to run if the choice matches the expression.
        5.A break statement, followed by a semicolon. If the previous choice matches the expression/value, the browser stops executing the code block here, and moves 
        on to any code that appears below the switch statement.
        6.As many other cases (bullets 3–5) as you like.
        7.The keyword default, followed by exactly the same code pattern as one of the cases (bullets 3–5), except that default does not have a choice after it, and 
        you don't need the break statement as there is nothing to run after this in the block anyway. This is the default option that runs if none of the choices match.
        
        Note: You don't have to include the default section — you can safely omit it if there is no chance that the expression could end up equaling an unknown value. 
        If there is a chance of this, however, you need to include it to handle unknown cases.
        
        A switch example is below (and also in the HTML)*/

        const select = document.querySelector('select');
        const para = document.querySelector('p');

        //select.onchange = setWeather;

        function setWeather() 
        {
            const choice = select.value;

            switch (choice) {

                case 'sunny':
                para.textContent = 'It is nice and sunny outside today. Wear shorts! Go to the beach, or the park, and get an ice cream.';
                break;

                case 'rainy':
                para.textContent = 'Rain is falling outside; take a rain coat and an umbrella, and don\'t stay out for too long.';
                break;

                case 'snowing':
                para.textContent = 'The snow is coming down — it is freezing! Best to stay in with a cup of hot chocolate, or go build a snowman.';
                break;

                case 'overcast':
                para.textContent = 'It isn\'t raining, but the sky is grey and gloomy; it could turn any minute, so take a rain coat just in case.';
                break;

                default:
                para.textContent = '';
            }
        }

        /*Ternary operator
        
        The ternary or conditional operator is a small bit of syntax that tests a condition and returns one value /expression if it is true, and another if it is false - 
        this can be useful in some situations, and can take up a lot less code than an if...else block if you have two choices that are chosen between via a true/false 
        condition. The pseudocode looks like this:
        
        condition ? run this code : run this code instead
        
        Let's look at this example:*/

        const greeting = isBirthday

        ? "Happy birthday Mrs. Smith — we hope you have a great day!"
        : "Good morning Mrs. Smith";

        /*Ternary operator example
        
        The ternary operator is not just for setting variable values; you can also run functions or lines of code - anything you like. If you look below, you will see that
        you can use this to select the theme of a website (i.e. a dark theme or a light theme!) which is super useful and, let's be honest, all websites should have!*/

        const select = document.querySelector('select');
        const html = document.querySelector('html');
        document.body.style.padding = '10px';

        function update(bgColor, textColor) {
        html.style.backgroundColor = bgColor;
        html.style.color = textColor;
        }

        select.addEventListener('change', () => select.value === 'black'
        ? update('black', 'white')
        : update('white', 'black')
        );
