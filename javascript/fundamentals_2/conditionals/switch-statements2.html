        /*Switch statements will always be written with:
        
        switch() {

        }
        
        Below is an example of a switch statement with two cases and a default case:
        
        switch (expression)
        {
            case x:
                //execute case x code block;
            break;

            case y:
		        // execute case y code block
		    break;
	        default:
		        // execute default code block
        }  
        
        Below is a working switch statement, in which we will find the current day of the week with the new Date() method.*/

        const day = new Date().getDay();


        switch (day)
        {
            case 0:
                console.log("It's Sunday, time to relax");
                break;
            case 1:
                console.log("Happy Monday");
                break;
            case 2: 
                console.log("It's Truesday. You got this!");
                break;
            case 3:
                console.log("Hump day already!");
                break;
            case 4: 
                console.log("Just one more day 'til the weekend");
                break;
            case 5: 
                console.log("Happy Friday!");
                break;
            case 6: 
                console.log("Have a wonderful Saturday!");
                break;
            default: 
                console.log("Something went horribly wrong...");
        }

        /*If we had omitted the break keyword in each statement, none of the other case statements would have evaluated to true, but the program would have continued 
        to check until it reached the end. In order to make our programs faster and more efficient, we include the break.*/

        /*In the below example, we assign a condition to each case to ouput a grade for a students test score.
        
        The expression in parentheses to be evaluated is "true" in this example. This means that any case that evaluates to true will be a match. As you can imagine, this
        is extremely useful when evaluating numbers.
        
        Just like with else if, switch is evaluated from top to bottom, so the first true match will be accepted. In this case, technically the score is still greater than,
        say, 60, so it is true for that case too, but the first true one has already been met:*/

        // Set the student's grade
        const grade = 87;

        switch (true) {
            // If score is 90 or greater
            case grade >= 90:
                console.log("A");
                break;
            // If score is 80 or greater
            case grade >= 80:
                console.log("B");
                break;
            // If score is 70 or greater
            case grade >= 70:
                console.log("C");
                break;
            // If score is 60 or greater
            case grade >= 60:
                console.log("D");
                break;
            // Anything 59 or below is failing
            default:
                console.log("F");
        }

        //The code above will, of course, output 'B' in the console!

        /*Sometimes, we may want to have the same output for multiple cases. In the example below, we express what season it is through evaulation of what month it is. Of course, 
        since, say, Spring covers multiple months, that output will have to have multiple cases. This is where we can list the cases and put 'break;' to easily distinguish between
        them.*/

        // Get number corresponding to the current month, with 0 being January and 11 being December
        const month = new Date().getMonth();

        switch (month) {
            // January, February, March
            case 0:
            case 1:
            case 2:
