        /*Data Types
        
        A value in JS is always of a certain type. For example, a string or a number. There are eight basic data types in JS. We'll cover them here in general.

        We can put any type in a variable. For example, a variable can at one moment be a string and then store a number:*/
        
        let message = "hello";
        message = 123456;

        //Languages that allow such things, such as JS, are called "dynamically typed", meaning that there exist data types, but variables are not bound by any of them.

        let n = 123;
        n = 12.345;

        /*Number
        
        The number type represents both ingeger and floating point numbers.
        
        There are many operations for numbers, e.g. multiplication (*), division (/), addition (+), subtraction (-), and so on.
        
        Besides regular numbers, there are also the so-called "special numeric values", which also belong to this data type: "Infinity", "-Infinity", and "NaN"
        
        We can get infinity as a result of division by zero:*/

        console.log(1 / 0);

        //Or just reference it directly:

        console.log(Infinity);

        //NaN represents a computational error. It is a result of an incorrect of an unfedined mathematical operation, for instance:

        console.log("not a number" / 2); //NaN, such a division is impossible

        //Additionally, any mathematical operation on NaN returns NaN:

        console.log(NaN + 1); //NaN

        /*The only exception is NaN ** 0, which outputs 1.

        We won't get 'fatal' errors in JS like in other languages - we can even divide by zero. At worst, we'll just get a NaN as the result.*/

        /*BigInt
        
        In JS, the "number" type cannot safely represent integer values larger than 2^(53)-1 (that's 9007199254740991), or less than -(253-1) for negatives. To be accurate, they can store larger
        numbers, but they will be less precise (and outside the safe integer range), because not all digits fit into the fixed 64-bit storage.
        
        For example, these two numbers below (which are just above the safe range), will return the same:*/

        console.log(9007199254740991 + 1); 9007199254740992
        console.log(9007199254740991 + 2); 9007199254740992

        //Of course, for most purposes, this range is enough, but sometimes we need the entire range of really big integers (in cryptography or microsecond-precision timestamps).
        //The BigInt value is created by appending n to the end of an integer:

        const bigInt = 1234567890123456789012345678901234567890n; //'n' added at the end.

        /*Strings
        
        In JS, there are three types of quotes (which Strings have to be surrounded by):
        
            Double quotes: "Hello".
            Single quotes: 'Hello'.
            Backticks: `Hello`./
        
        Double and single quotes are "simple" quotes. There's practically no difference between them in JS.

        However, backticks are "extended functionality" quotes. They allow to embed variables and expressions into a string by wrapping them in ${...}, for example:*/ 

        let name = "John";

        //embed a variable
        console.log(`Hello, ${name}!`); //Hello John!

        //embed an expression
        console.log(`the result is ${1 + 2}`); //the result is 3

        /*Boolean (logical type)
        
        The boolean type only has two values: true and fale.

        This is commonly used to store yes/no values. For instance:*/

        let nameFieldChecked = true; //yes, name field is checked
        let nameAgeChecked = false; //no, name field is not checked

        //Boolean values also come as a result of comparisons:

        let isGreater = 4 > 1;

        console.log(isGreater); //true

        /*The "null" value
        
        The special null value does not belong to any of the types described above. It forms a seperate type of its own which contains only the null value:*/

        let age = null;

        /*In JS, null is not a "reference to a non-existing object" or a "null pointer" like in some other languages. It's just a special value used to represent
        "nothing", "empty", or "value unknown"
        
        The code above states that the age is unknown*/

        /*The "undefined" value
        
        The special value "undefined" also stands apart. It's a type on it's own, like the "null" value.
        
        The meaning of undefined is "value is not assigned" (rather than value is not known!). If a variable is declared, but not assigned, then it's value is unknown:*/

        let birthday;

        console.log(birthday); //shows "undefined"

        /*Objects and Symbols
        
        The object type is special.
        
        All other types are called primitive because their values can contain only a single thing (a string, number, or whatever). In contract, objects are used to store collections
        of data and more complex entities.
        
        The symbol type is used to create uniquie identifiers for objects.*/

        /*The typeof operator
        
        This returns the type of the operand. It's useful when we want to process values of different types differently or just want to do a quite check. A call to typeof x
        returns a string with the type name:*/

        typeof undefined; //undefined
        typeof 0; //number
        typeof 10n; //bigint
        typeof true; //boolean
        typeof "foo"; //string
        typeof Symbol("id"); //symbol
        typeof Math; //object
        typeof null; //object
        typeof alert; //function

        /*Summary
        
        There are 8 basic data types in JavaScript.

        Seven primitive data types:
            number for numbers of any kind: integer or floating-point, integers are limited by ±(253-1).
            bigint for integer numbers of arbitrary length.
            string for strings. A string may have zero or more characters, there’s no separate single-character type.
            boolean for true/false.
            null for unknown values – a standalone type that has a single value null.
            undefined for unassigned values – a standalone type that has a single value undefined.
            symbol for unique identifiers.
            
        And one non-primitive data type:
            object for more complex data structures.*/
