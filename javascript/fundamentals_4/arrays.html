        /*Arrays
        
        There are two ways to create an array:*/

        const cars = ["Saab", "BMW", "Volvo"];

        /*You can also do this spanning multiple lines:*/

        const cars2 = 
        [
            "Saab",
            "BMW",
            "Volvo"
        ];

        //You can call an array into the log like so:

        console.log(cars[1]); //BMW (remember, arrays count from 0!)

        /*You can also declare an array like below, however this is not recommended as it is not as clean:*/

        const cars3 = new Array("Saab", "BMW", "Volvo"); //This does exactly the same thing, but is just more word-heavy.

        //You can change an array element like so:

        cars[1] = "Vauxhall";
        console.log(cars[1]); //Vauxhall

        /*Access the full array
        
        To access the array in JS, you can refer to the array name:*/

        document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML = cars; //so, here we are saying, look at this document and in it the element by the id named "demo". Now, in the HTML print (=) the cars array.

        /*Arrays vs Objects
        
        Technically, arrays are a special type of object. If you ask JS to print out the typeof for an array, it will return "object"
        
        But arrays are just best described as an array - they use numbers to access their "elements" (such as "cars[1]" Objects on the other hand use names to access it's "members". In the example,
        person.firstname would return "John":*/

        const person = {firstName: "John", lastName: "Doe", age: 46};

        console.log(person.firstName); //John

        /*Array elements can be objects
        
        JS variables can be objects - like we said above, arrays are a special kind of object.
        
        Because of this, you can have variables of different types in the same Array.
        
        You can have objects in an array. You can have functions in an array, and you can even have arrays in an array!*/

        /*Array Properties and Methods
        
        The really power of arrays are the built in methods, such as:*/

        console.log(cars.length); //Returns the number of elements (in this case 3)
        console.log(cars.sort()); //Sorts the array (in this case returns alphabetically!)

        //You can also assign these values as variables, so it's a little easier. For example, a small class alphabetically:

        const studentNames = ["Joe", "David", "Louis", "Sonia", "Ollie", "Rhianna", "Megan"];

        let studentNamesSort = studentNames.sort();

        console.log(studentNamesSort); //(7)Â ['David', 'Joe', 'Louis', 'Megan', 'Ollie', 'Rhianna', 'Sonia']

        /*Accessing the last array of an element
        
        You can of course access the first array like so: cars[0], but to access the last array, you can either give the number order, but in the case of a long list of 
        elements, you can do this (rather than counting!)*/

        let lastStudent = studentNamesSort[studentNamesSort.length - 1];
        console.log(lastStudent); //Sonia

        /*Adding Array Elements
        
        The easiest way to add a new element to an array is using the push() method:*/

        studentNames.push("Katie"); //Adds "Katie" to studentNames

        //In JS, arrays ALWAYS use numbered indexes (i.e. cars[0], cars[1] etc.)

        /*The difference between arrays and objects:
        
        In JS, arrays always use numbered indexes.
        In JS, objects always use named indexes*/

        /*JS new Array()
        
        JS has a built in array constructor "new Array()".
        
        However, you can just use [] instead. These two create exactly the same array*/

        const points = new Array(1, 2, 3, 4);
        const points2 = [1, 2, 3, 4];

        /*How to recognise an Array
        
        The problem is that the JS operator typeof will return an object:*/

        let type = typeof studentNames; 
        
        console.log(type); //"object"

        //To get around this, there are two solutions - one is to use the Array.isArray() or the instanceof Array commands - both return true if something is an array:

        console.log(Array.isArray(studentNames)); //true

        console.log(studentNames instanceof Array); //true
