        words, UP TO AND INCLUDING 0. If we set it as >= 10, well "i" is already equal to 10, so the iteration just stops there. Alternatively, if we set it to <= 10, well it's already equal to
        10 AND there are INFINITE numbers underneath it, so it doesn't know when to stop, and loops forever!

        Because we are counting DOWN, the final operand should be the LAST iteration. Hence here this is ZERO.

            //Critically, we need to pass the variable para (which we defined in the if statement above) into the output variable via a 'appendChild' command. This actually prints out the result
            //without it, you just get a blank page!
            output.appendChild(para);
            //Finally, we have to provide a final expression. The variable i started at 10, and we want it to countdown, hence we decrement it. We have expressed above that we wish to loop to 
            //continue until it is equal to 0. Hence it counts down until it hits 0!

        /*REFLECTION
        
            Looking at this now it's complete, what was difficult was getting your head around the maths. When counting down and wanting the MAX number to be the current value of the variable
            (in this case 10), we need to DECREMENT the variable - that's obvious. But there is a fatal error that in the WHILE loop, you need to define the condition as the FINAL number you 
            want it to pass through (it would be the same if you were counting up, but this would be the MAX rather than MIN number). 
            
            So, initially we were saying while (i <= 10) - because we want the loop to carry on whilst it's less than 10, right? No, because it goes beyond zero - to -1, -2, etc. and then forever!

            The HTML - JS reaction stuff (appendChild() and createElement()) was a little tricky, but that's because we haven't really gotten on to that yet!
