        /*Looping through a collection
        
            When using a loop, you want to loop through a collection. One type of collection is an Array. But there are also other collections in JS too, such as "Set" and "Map".
            
            The for...of loop
            
            This is the basic tool for looping through a collection:*/

            const cats = ["Leopard", "Serval", "Jaguar", "Tiger", "Caracal", "Lion"];

            for (const cat of cats)
            {
                console.log(cat); //Loops through the elements of the arrays one at a time.
            }

            /*In this example, for (const cat of cats) says:

            1.  Given the collection cats, get the first item in the collection.
            2.  Assign it to the variable cat and then run the code between the curly brackets {}.
            3.  Get the next item, and repeat (2) until you've reached the end of the collection.*/

        /*map() and filter()
        
            JS also has more specialised loops for collections - these are two of them.
            
            You can use map() to do something to each item in a collection and create a new collection containing the changed items:*/

            function toUpper(string)
            {
                return string.toUpperCase();
            }

            const upperCats = cats.map(toUpper);

            console.log(upperCats); //'LEOPARD', 'SERVAL', 'JAGUAR', 'TIGER', 'CARACAL', 'LION'

            /*Here, map() calls the function once for each item in the array, passing in the item. It then adds the return value from each function call to a new array, and finally
            returns the new array. In this case the function we provide converts the item to upper case, so the resulting array contains all our cats in uppercase.
            
            You can use filter() to test each item in a collection and create a new one containing only those items which match:*/

            function lCat(cat)
            {
                return cat.startsWith("L");
            }

            //declare const cats (already declared)

            const filtered = cats.filter(lCat);

            console.log(filtered); //'Leopard', 'Lion'

            /*This looks like map(), but the function we pass returns a boolean (i.e. is it TRUE that the element begins with "L".
            
            NOTE: both map() and filter are often used with function expressions (which we learned about in fundamentals_3. Such as arrow functions:*/

            const filteredS = cats.filter((cat) => cat.startsWith("S"));
            console.log(filteredS); //"Serval"

        /*The standard for loop
        
            The syntax for this is as follows:
            
                for (initializer; condition; final-expression)
                {
                    //code to run
                }
            
            Here we have:
            
                1   The keyword for, followed by parentheses
                2   Inside the parentheses we have three items seperated by ';':
                    i   An initializer - sets a variable to a number, which is incremented to count the number of times to loop has run. Also sometimes refered to as a counter 
                        variable.
                    ii  A condition - this defines when the loop should stop looping. This is generally an expression featuring a comparison operator, a test to see if the exit 
                        condition has been met.
                    iii A final expression = this is always evaluated (or run) each time the loop has gone through a full iteration. It usually serves to increment (or decrement)
                        the counter variable, to bring it closer to the point where the condition is no longer 'true'.
                3   Some curly brackets that contain a block of code - this code will be run each time the loop iterates. */
                        
        /*Calculating squares
        
            Here is a great example of how to run a for loop with some very basic times tables (squares up to 9):*/

            let results;

            function calculate()
            {
                for(let i = 1; i < 10; i++)
                {
                    const newResult = `${i} x ${i} = ${i * i}\n`;
                    return(newResult)
                }
            }

        /*Looping through collections with a for loop
        
            In the code above on cats, we wrote the following:
            
            for (const cat of cats)
                {
                    console.log(cat);
                }
            
            We could also write it like so:*/

            for(let i = 0; i < cats.length; i++)
            {
                console.log(cats[i]);
            }
            /*Here we are stating that i should stop at the length of the array. In early iterations of JS the for...of loop didn't exist - so this was the standard way of looping through an array.

            However, for...of is just much easier, so I would recommend sticking to that.
            
            BUT sometimes you might need to use a for loop to iterate through an array, such as in the code below we want to log a message listing our cats:*/

            /*const catNames = ["Rex", "Ron", "Bobby"];

            let myFavouriteCats = "My cats are called ";

            for (const favCat of catNames)
            {
                myFavouriteCats += `${favCat} `
            }

            console.log(myFavouriteCats); //My cats are called Pete, Biggles, Jasmine,*/

            //Instead, we should do the following:

            const catNames = ["Rex", "Ron", "Bobby"];

            let myFavouriteCats = "My cats are called ";

            for(let i = 0; i < catNames.length; i++)
            {
                if (i === catNames.length - 1)
                {
                    //We are at the end of the array
                    myFavouriteCats += `and ${catNames[i]}.`
                } else
                {
                    myFavouriteCats += `${catNames[i]}, `
                }
            }

            console.log(myFavouriteCats); //My cats are called Rex, Ron, and Bobby.

        /*Exiting loops with break
        
            To exit a loop BEFORE ALL ITERATIONS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED, you can use the 'break' statment (just like in the switch statement!). When the code reaches a truthy
            iteration in a switch statement, it exits the statement because it reaches 'break;'. It's the same with loops.
            
            Example: we want to search through an array of contacts and telephone numbers and return just the number we wanted to find? We had to add some simple HTML to do 
            this - a text <input> allowing us to enter a name to search for, a <button> element to submit a search, and a <p> element to display the results in.
                
            Now, the JS:*/

            const contacts = ["Chris:2232322", "Sarah:3453456", "Bill:7654322", "Mary:9998769", "Dianne:9384975"]
            const para = document.querySelector("p");
            const input = document.querySelector("input");
            const btn = document.querySelector("button");

            btn.addEventListener("click", () => 
            {
                const searchName = input.value.toLowerCase();
                input.value = "";
                input.focus();
                para.textContent = "";
                for (const contact of contacts)
                {
                    const splitContact = contact.split(":");
                    if (splitContact[0].toLowerCase() === searchName)
                    {
                        para.textContent = `${splitContact[0]}'s number is ${splitContact[1]}.`;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if (para.textContent === "")
                {
                    para.textContent = "Contact not found";
                }
            });

            /*
            1   Firstly, we have some variable definitions, including an array of the contact name and number - each item is a string and contains two things seperated by a 
                colon.
            2   We then attach the event listener to the button (btn), so when it's pressed some code is run and it returns a result.
            3   We store the value entered into a variable called searchName and then empty it. We also run toLowerCase() so that it is case-insensitive.
            4   In the for...of loop:
                i   We split the current contact at the colon character, and store the resulting two values in an array called splitContact.
                ii  We then run a conditional statement to test whether splitContact[0] (this being the contacts name) is equal to the searchName. If it is, we enter a string into the
                    paragraph to report what the contact's number is, and use break to end the loop
            5   After this, we check whether searchName is a contact and, if not, return some text ("Contract not found"). */
        
        /*Skipping iterations with continue
        
            You can also, in a for loop, skip iterations with 'continue'. The syntax for this is like so:
            
            for (let i = 1; i <= variable; i++)
            {
                code in function;
                if (condition)
                {
                    continue;
                }
            } 
            
            "break" will set out of the function if the condition is true. Continue, on the other hand, will just skip over that iteration instead!
            
            For example:
            
            for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++) 
            {
                let sqRoot = Math.sqrt(i);
                if (Math.floor(sqRoot) !== sqRoot) 
                {
                    continue;
                }

                console.log(`${i} `);
            }
            
            What we are saying here is that if the variable sqRoot (defined as Math.sqrt(i) is NOT a sqRoot, then skip over that iteration. In other words, this function will print 
            out the square roots up to a stated number.*/

        /*while and do...while
        
            for is not the only type of loop available in JS. There are actually many others.
            
            The while loop looks like so:
            
                initializer
                while (condition)
                {
                    //code to run

                    final-expression
                } 
                
            This is similar to the for loop, except that the initializer variable is set before the loop, and the final-expression is included inside the loop after the code is run
            rather than these two items being included inside the parenteses. Lets look at an example! */

            const pets = ["Hugo", "Ziggy", "Louis"];

            let myFavouritePets = "My pets are called ";

            let i = 0;

            while (i < pets.length)
            {
                if (i === pets.length - 1)
                {
                    myFavouritePets += `and ${pets[i]}.`;
                } else 
                {
                    myFavouritePets += `${pets[i]}, `;
                }

                i++
            }

            console.log(myFavouritePets); //My pets are called Hugo, Ziggy, and Louis.

            /*The do...while loop is very similar, but provides a variation on the while structure
            
            initializer
            
            do
            {
                //code to run;

                final-expression;
            } while (condition) 
            
            The main difference between the two is that the code inside a do...while loop is always executed AT LEAST ONCE. That's beacause the condition comes after the code inside the
            loop. In while and for loops, this check comes first, so the code may never execute.
            
            Again, another example:*/

            const insects = ["Ant", "Bee", "Butterfly"];

            let myFavouriteInsects = "My insects are called ";

            let a = 0; //calling it a instead of i because of previous variable

            do 
            {
                if (a === insects.length - 1)
                {
                    myFavouriteInsects += `and ${insects[a]}.`;
                } else
                {
                    myFavouriteInsects += `${insects[a]}, `;
                }

                a++;
            } while (a < insects.length);

            console.log(myFavouriteInsects); //My insects are called Ant, Bee, and Butterfly.

            /*Warning: With while and do...while — as with all loops — you must make sure that the initializer is incremented or, depending on the case, decremented, so the condition 
            eventually becomes false. If not, the loop will go on forever, and either the browser will force it to stop, or it will crash. This is called an infinite loop.*/

        /*Conclusion - which loop should I use?
        
        If you're iterating through an array or some other object that supports it, and don't NEED ACCESS to the index position of EACH item, then 'for...of' is the best choice. It's 
        very easy to read and there#s less to go wrong.
        
        For other uses, 'for', 'while' and 'do...while' are largely interchangable. They can all be used to solve the same problems, and which one you use will largely depend on personal
        preference. Although for() is recommended to begin with, as it's probably the easiest to remember - the initializer, conditiuon, and final expression all go into the parentheses, 
        and, at any rate, we've seen them lots before!
        
        To conclude on the syntax:
        
        FOR...OF
            
            for (const item of array) 
            {
                // code to run
            }
            
        FOR

            for (initializer; condition; final-expression) 
            {
                // code to run
            }

        WHILE

            initializer
            while (condition) 
            {
                // code to run

                final-expression
            }
        
        DO...WHILE

            initializer
            do 
            {
                // code to run

                final-expression
            } while (condition)
