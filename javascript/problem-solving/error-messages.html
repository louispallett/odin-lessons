        /*This lesson looks over:
        
        1   Name at least three kinds of JS errors
        2   Identify two parts of an error message that help you find where the error originates
        3   Be able to understand how to research and resolve errors
        
        The Anatomy of an Error
        
        An error consists of a name/type and a message. They contain crucial information which will help you solve any problems and what is causing the issue.
        
        Let's assume we have written the following code:*/

        const a = "Hello"
        const b = "World"

        console.log(c)

        /*This will run, but it will generate an error. This is called a "throwing error". This error is called a ReferenceError:
        
            Uncaught ReferenceError: c is not defined
                at error-messages.html:26*/

        /*Common types of errors
        
        1   Syntax error
            
                This is caused when the code you are running is not written correctly. For example:*/

                function helloWorld()
                {
                    console.log "Hello World!"
                }

                /*we forgot to add the parentheses for console.log()!

        2   Reference Error
                
                As above, these arise because whatever variable you are trying to reference doesn't exist (WITHIN the current scope - remember function declarations 
                and expressions) - or it has simply been spelled incorrectly!

        3   Type Error

                These errors are thrown for a few different reasons:

                    an operand or argument passed to a function is incompatible with the type expected by that operator or function;
                    or when attempting to modify a value that cannot be changed;
                    or when attempting to use a value in an inappropriate way.    

                Say we have two strings that you would like to combine to create one message, such as below:*/

                const str1 = "Hello";
                const str2 = "World!";
                const message = str1.push(str2);

                /*Uncaught TypeError: str1.push is not a function
                
                This is quite common but confuses a lot of learners, because .push IS a method - however, it's a method for arrays, NOT strings. Hence, it is "not a 
                function" in this case - we should change .push() to .concat() - which is a proper string method - and the code will run.
                
        Remember the Chrome Debugger (https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/javascript/) - you can set breakpoints to understand what is going on.
        
        And finally, make use of the console. You can use console.log() but also console.table() and console.trace() - there is a full list here (https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/obj_console.asp)
        
    Warnings: one final thing, warnings are not errors - if you see a warning this is an 'advisory' note - they should be resolved if possible, but won't stop the code running at
    that time (but may if circumstances change)*/
