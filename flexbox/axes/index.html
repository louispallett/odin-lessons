Axes

    The most confusing thing about flexbox is that it can work either horizontally or vertically, and the way those rules work change depending on whether we are 
    dealing with horizontal or vertical direction.

    The default direction for a flex container is horizontal, or 'row', but you can change the direction to vertical, or 'column'. The direction can be specified
    in CSS like so:

    .flex-container {
        flex-direction: column;
    }

Main and cross axes

    No matter which direction is being used, flex-containers need to be thought of as having 2 axes: the main axis and the cross axis. It is the direction of these
    axes that changes when the flex direction is changed. In most circumstances, flex-direction: row puts the main axis horizontal (left-to-right), and column puts
    the main axis vertical (top-to-bottom).

    In other words, if we put display: flex; on a div and it arranged its children horizontally. This is a demonstration of flex-direction: row;, the default setting.
    The following example (in the styles.css file) is very similar.
